## **1. Introduction & Installation**

- **What is Docker?**

  - Brief explanation of containerization
  - Differences between containers and virtual machines

  **Containerization** is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to package an application along with all its dependencies (libraries, configs, binaries) into a single **container**. This container can run consistently on any environment that supports Docker — whether it's your laptop, a cloud server, or someone else's machine.

  Unlike traditional virtual machines, **containers don't include a full operating system**. Instead, they share the host system’s OS kernel, making them much faster and more efficient.

- **Why use Docker?**

  - Portability, consistency, lightweight, isolated environments

- **Installation Guide**

  - Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)
  - Docker Engine (Linux)
  - Basic verification: `docker --version`, `docker run hello-world`

------

## **2. Creating Your First Docker Container**

- **Understanding Docker Architecture**
  - Client, Daemon, Images, Containers
  - Diagram: Docker engine, containers, interaction with OS/user
- **Dockerfile Basics**
  - Syntax: `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`, `EXPOSE`
  - Building image: `docker build -t myapp .`
- **(Optional)**: Touch on `docker-compose.yaml` if relevant to multi-container setups

------

## **3. Sharing Files with Docker Volumes**

- **What are Volumes?**
  - Difference between bind mounts and named volumes
- **Creating and Using Volumes**
  - Command-line: `-v` flag
  - Example: sharing a local folder with a container
- **Use Case**
  - Live code editing
  - Database persistence

------

## **4. Packaging and Sharing Docker Images**

- **Saving Images**
  - `docker save` and `docker load`
  - `docker tag` for naming
- **Pushing to Docker Hub**
  - Login and tagging: `docker tag myapp username/myapp`
  - `docker push username/myapp`
- **Best Practices**
  - `.dockerignore` usage
  - Small base images (e.g., Alpine)

------

## **5. Using Prebuilt Docker Containers**

- **Pulling and Running Images**
  - Examples: `sqlite`, `nginx`, `wordpress`, etc.
  - Commands: `docker pull`, `docker run`
- **Real-World Example**
  - Launch a blog with a prebuilt image (e.g., Ghost CMS)
  - Connect to external volume and configure
